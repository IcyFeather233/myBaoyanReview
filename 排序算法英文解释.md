# Selection Sort Algorithm

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

The square of n

# Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent  elements if they are in the wrong order. 

The square of n

# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 

The square of n

# Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is considered as an example of the divide and conquer strategy. So, in this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner. We can think of it as a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided. This means that if the array becomes empty or has only one element left, the dividing will stop. it is the base case to stop the recursion. If the array has multiple elements, we split the array into halves and recursively invoke the merge sort on each of the halves. Finally, when both the halves are sorted, the merge operation is applied. Merge operation is the process of taking two smaller sorted arrays and combining them to eventually make a larger one.

# QuickSort

Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

N*logN

# HeapSort

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

Sort: NlogN
Final: NlogN



# Bucket Sort

Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. s bucket algorithm.

1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
.......a) Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
3) Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.


KlogK, K = n / m, n nums, m buckets

# ShellSort
Shell sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of ShellSort is to allow the exchange of far items. In Shell sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every h’th element are sorted.

# Radix Sort
First create the array A[MaxValue]; Each number is then placed at the corresponding position; The final iteration of the array is the result of the sort.
